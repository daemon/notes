Disorganized notes from this EMNLP 2019.

# Overall
- Playing it cautious: assume worst to bad for reviewers.
- Paper should be mostly self-contained, but this is not a huge deal if short on space -- move details to appendix.
- Justify every (important) choice carefully.
- Justify why a popular alternative was not chosen, e.g., CNNs vs RNNs. No need to justify QRNNs vs CNNs.
- Structure experiments consistently, e.g., same procedure throughout.
- Design hypothesis first, keep revisiting it in the paper.
- Ablate the same datasets throughout, so as not to raise eyebrows.
- Refer to Bowman's slides.

## KD long
Converged on time. Satisfactory quality.
- Core weakness is simple technique, but the analyses are rigorous.
- Lots of feedback and help from L.
- Anonymous code release is bonus.

## KD short
Converged on time. Satisfactory quality.
- Core weakness is that baseline is arXiv baseline.
- Ran out of room as well.
- Submit to the right track next time.
- Anonymous data release is bonus.

## DC short
Didn't converge on time. Unsatisfactory quality.
- Provide feedback and oversight earlier, don't assume paper is under control.
- Check the actual paper more frequently.
- Results and logic were mostly fine; presentation needed work.
